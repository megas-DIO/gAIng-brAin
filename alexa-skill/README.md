Your gAIng-Brain API must support:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |

The API must be accessible via HTTPS for Alexa to connect.

2. Select your skill
3. Go to "Test" tab
4. Type or speak commands

## Troubleshooting

### "I'm having trouble connecting"
- Ensure gAIng-Brain server is running
- Check API URL is HTTPS
- Verify API is publicly accessible

### Skill not responding
- Check Lambda logs in AWS CloudWatch
- Verify environment variables are set
- Test API endpoints directly

### Timeouts
- Alexa has an 8-second timeout
- Ensure your API responds quickly
- Consider caching frequent responses

## Security

- Never commit real API keys
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Enable HTTPS for API endpoints
- Restrict Lambda execution role
