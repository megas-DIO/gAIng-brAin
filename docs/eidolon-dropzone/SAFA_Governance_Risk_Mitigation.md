## **SECTION 2: COMPLETE RISK MITIGATION PLAYBOOK (Decision Trees)**

### **SCENARIO 1: SBIR PHASE 1 REJECTION (Probability: 55-65%)**

**Trigger:** SBA sends rejection letter (around June 2026)

**Decision Tree:**

```
SBIR REJECTED
    ↓
    └─ Reason analysis
        ├─ "Budget exceeds $150K"
        │  └─ Action: Resubmit Phase 2 ($1M) in Q3 2026
        │     Timeline: 6-week rework
        │     Impact: 3-month delay
        │
        ├─ "Technical feasibility unclear"
        │  └─ Action: Run smaller pilot with personal capital ($50K)
        │     Timeline: 3 months
        │     Impact: Proof of concept, reapply as Phase 1 or Phase 2
        │
        ├─ "Commercialization plan weak"
        │  └─ Action: Lock fleet partnership, submit customer letters
        │     Timeline: 4 weeks
        │     Impact: Resubmit with commercial validation
        │
        └─ "Not innovative enough"
           └─ Action: Emphasize patent uniqueness, zero competitors
              Timeline: 2 weeks rework
              Impact: Resubmit with stronger IP narrative
```

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Pivot to Arkansas State Grants** ($250K-$500K)
   - AR Economic Development Commission grants
   - Timeline: Apply Q2 2026 (if SBIR rejected)
   - Success probability: 60-70% (regional focus is advantage)

2. **Pivot to Angel Funding** ($500K-$1M)
   - Approach Series A investors for angel round (pre-SBIR)
   - Accept higher dilution (25-30% vs 20% at Series A)
   - Timeline: 8-12 weeks to close
   - Advantage: Funds pilot, then SBIR becomes gravy

3. **Stretch Phase 1 Pilot with Founder Capital**
   - Use personal savings ($25-50K)
   - Run 2-month minimum pilot with backup fleet
   - Generate proof-of-concept data
   - Reapply to SBIR Phase 2 with data
   - Timeline: 6 months total

**Success Criteria:** Pilot runs with SOME funding, data collected, Series A ready

**Worst Case:** No SBIR, bootstrap Phase 1 on founder capital, 12-month delay to Series A

---

### **SCENARIO 2: FLEET PARTNER DELAY / CANCELLATION (Probability: 30%)**

**Trigger:** Fleet operator delays response >2 weeks OR cancels pilot

**Decision Tree:**

```
FLEET PARTNER UNRESPONSIVE / CANCELS
    ↓
    └─ Root cause analysis
        ├─ "Too busy during holiday season"
        │  └─ Action: Follow up in January (when back in office)
        │     Timeline: 2 weeks
        │     Impact: Minimal (delay only)
        │
        ├─ "Concerned about data privacy"
        │  └─ Action: Strengthen NDA, offer anonymization
        │     Timeline: 1 week
        │     Impact: Minimal (resolves concern)
        │
        ├─ "Union resistance to pilot"
        │  └─ Action: Engage Teamsters directly, emphasize job preservation
        │     Timeline: 2-4 weeks
        │     Impact: May require union sign-off, worth the investment
        │
        └─ "Operational complexity (can't spare 20 trucks)"
           └─ Action: Reduce to 10 trucks, extend timeline to 9 months
              Timeline: Immediate renegotiation
              Impact: Smaller dataset, but pilot still viable
```

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Activate Backup Fleet List** (Already researched)
   - Have 3 backup fleet operators on speed-dial
   - Call within 48 hours of primary partner delay
   - Timeline: 2-4 weeks to lock backup

2. **Hire Contracted Fleet Ops** (More expensive, but derisk)
   - Rent 20 trucks + drivers from contractor fleet
   - Cost: 40-50% higher than partnership, but guaranteed availability
   - Timeline: 4-6 weeks to deploy
   - Advantage: Full control, predictable, insurance-included

3. **Reduce Pilot Scope** (Lower cost, faster execution)
   - Pilot with 10 trucks instead of 20 (keep 1 route instead of 2)
   - Timeline: Unchanged (still 6 months)
   - Cost: $17.5K instead of $35K
   - Data quality: Still statistically valid (smaller N)

**Success Criteria:** Pilot runs with SOME fleet operator, data collected

**Worst Case:** Contract fleet ops (expensive), 4-week delay, pilot still viable

---

### **SCENARIO 3: INVESTOR DISENGAGEMENT (Probability: 20-30%)**

**Trigger:** Warm investors go cold, no meetings scheduled by mid-January

**Decision Tree:**

```
INVESTOR WARM INTROS NOT CONVERTING
    ↓
    └─ Root cause analysis
        ├─ "Pitch not compelling enough"
        │  └─ Action: Iterate pitch based on feedback
        │     Timeline: 1 week
        │     Impact: Minimal
        │
        ├─ "Market conditions changed (recession fears, etc.)"
        │  └─ Action: Emphasize SBIR funding (derisk VC capital)
        │     Timeline: Immediate repositioning
        │     Impact: Repositioning narrative, not business model
        │
        ├─ "Series A timing seems premature (SBIR not yet approved)"
        │  └─ Action: Clarify Series A timing is Q4 2026 (AFTER SBIR approval)
        │     Timeline: 1 week communication
        │     Impact: Minimal
        │
        └─ "Job preservation message not resonating"
           └─ Action: Pivot messaging to infrastructure/climate/energy angle
              Timeline: 1 week
              Impact: Same business, different positioning
```

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **SBIR Phase 1 Approval = Re-engagement** (High Probability)
   - SBIR approval (May 2026) is massive credibility signal
   - Re-reach out to all warm investors: "SBIR approved, pilot live, here's data"
   - Success probability: 80%+ (regulatory backing + proof of concept)

2. **Focus on Series A Investor Niches**
   - Not ALL VCs understand job preservation angle
   - BUT: Climate VCs, infrastructure VCs, impact VCs DO
   - Re-target to 3 investor subtypes: Climate + Infrastructure + Impact
   - Success probability: 60-70%

3. **Strategic Corporate Investment Alternative**
   - Approach J.B. Hunt, Schneider, fleet operators as investors
   - They have capital + direct customer interest
   - Check size: $5-20M (less than VC, but strategic advantage)
   - Success probability: 40-50%

**Success Criteria:** Series A conversations initiated by Q4 2026 (even if not closed yet)

**Worst Case:** Strategic corporate investment instead of VC, 12-18 month delay, still fundable

---

### **SCENARIO 4: PATENT LANDSCAPE SHIFT (Probability: 10%)**

**Trigger:** Competitor files similar patent AFTER our provisional filed

**Decision Tree:**

```
COMPETITOR FILES SIMILAR PATENT
    ↓
    └─ Analysis of competitor patent
        ├─ "Our claims are broader, prior art different"
        │  └─ Action: Attorney reviews, we have defensible moat
        │     Timeline: 2 weeks analysis
        │     Impact: Minimal (our patents still strong)
        │
        ├─ "Their claims overlap with ours significantly"
        │  └─ Action: Attorney files continuation/CIP to expand claims
        │     Timeline: 4-8 weeks filing
        │     Impact: Adds defensive patents, costs $3-5K
        │
        └─ "They copied our exact innovation"
           └─ Action: Patent office contest (oppositions/Inter Partes Review)
              Timeline: 6-24 months legal battle
              Impact: Expensive, but we have first-mover + SBIR data advantage
```

**Mitigation (Proactive):**

1. **File provisionals IMMEDIATELY** (45-day window critical)
   - We have first-mover advantage if filed by Jan 22, 2026
   - First-to-file = strong patent position

2. **Public disclosure after filing** (strategic advantage)
   - After provisional filed, publicly disclose in SBIR proposal
   - Disclosure date becomes prior art against competitors
   - Prevents anyone else from patenting the same thing

3. **Aggressive utility patent prosecution** (Year 2-3)
   - Convert provisionals to utility patents with broad claims
   - Use pilot data as evidence of feasibility + commercial value
   - Make utility patents very difficult to design around

**Success Criteria:** Our patents issued, competitors design around us (costly)

**Worst Case:** Patent lands, but we had first-mover + data + SBIR validation = moat holds

---

### **SCENARIO 5: BUDGET OVERRUN (Probability: 15-20%)**

**Trigger:** Actual spend exceeds budget by >10% ($15K over $150K SBIR)

**Decision Tree:**

```
SBIR PHASE 1 BUDGET OVERRUN DETECTED
    ↓
    └─ Root cause analysis
        ├─ "Attorney fees higher than estimated"
        │  └─ Action: Negotiate fixed-fee patent conversion (post-Phase 1)
        │     Timeline: 1 week
        │     Impact: $2-3K savings available
        │
        ├─ "Pilot ops cost more (fuel, insurance) than projected"
        │  └─ Action: Optimize fleet logistics, negotiate fuel discounts
        │     Timeline: Ongoing
        │     Impact: $1-2K monthly savings
        │
        ├─ "Personnel costs increased"
        │  └─ Action: Hire contractor instead of FTE for specific tasks
        │     Timeline: Immediate adjustment
        │     Impact: Flexible cost structure
        │
        └─ "Scope creep (more tasks than planned)"
           └─ Action: Cut low-priority R&D, focus on critical path items
              Timeline: Immediate reprioritization
              Impact: Minimal (Phase 1 objectives still met)
```

**Contingency Plan:**

1. **Draw from Phase 2 budget** (if approved early)
   - SBIR Phase 2 ($1M) can fund Phase 1 overruns
   - Timeline: Possible if Phase 1 approved early

2. **Founder capital injection** (temporary)
   - Inject $15-25K personal capital to cover overrun
   - Pay back from Series A or Phase 2 approval
   - Timeline: Immediate (if available)

3. **Accelerate Series A** (if metrics strong)
   - If pilot data shows 80%+ job retention + 20%+ cost savings
   - Early Series A conversations (Q3 2026 instead of Q4)
   - Timeline: 8-12 weeks fundraising
   - Impact: Full runway to scale, no overrun stress

**Success Criteria:** Phase 1 completed within 10% of budget, objectives met

**Worst Case:** Overrun by 20% ($30K), founder capital covers, still on track

---

### **SCENARIO 6: MARKET COMPETITION EMERGES (Probability: 25%)**

**Trigger:** Competitor raises Series A funding with similar job-preservation angle

**Decision Tree:**

```
COMPETITOR ENTERS MARKET
    ↓
    └─ Competitive analysis
        ├─ "They're 2-3 months behind us"
        │  └─ Action: Accelerate pilot data collection, publish results
        │     Timeline: Immediate (30 days)
        │     Impact: First-mover advantage cements
        │
        ├─ "They raised more VC capital than us ($50M vs $25M)"
        │  └─ Action: Lean on grant funding ($1.15M) + IP moat
        │     Timeline: Strategic repositioning
        │     Impact: Different competitive advantages (IP vs capital)
        │
        ├─ "Their patent claims are broader than ours"
        │  └─ Action: Attorney files defensive patents, continuation applications
        │     Timeline: 4-8 weeks
        │     Impact: Costs $5-10K, strengthens our moat
        │
        └─ "They're targeting same fleet operators as us"
           └─ Action: Accelerate fleet partnerships (close 3-5 by Q2 2026)
              Timeline: 8 weeks
              Impact: Lock customers, raise switching costs
```

**Mitigation (Proactive):**

1. **Scale faster than competitors**
   - SBIR Phase 2 ($1M) funded before competitors get Series A
   - 500+ trucks deployed by end of Phase 2
   - Scale advantage = defensible moat

2. **Patent fortress** (already planned)
   - 3 core patents + 4 subsidiary patents = hard to design around
   - Competitors would need $5-10M legal budget to challenge

3. **Network effects**
   - Each fleet operator we sign = data advantage
   - Each driver in our system = intelligence advantage
   - Network effects scale faster than capital

**Success Criteria:** We're still market leader despite competition

**Worst Case:** Competitor raises more capital, but our patents + SBIR + pilots keep us ahead

1. **Identify the decision** (What are we deciding?)
2. **List options** (What are the alternatives?)
3. **Analyze each option** (Pros, cons, timeline, capital required)
4. **Recommend best option** (Based on: speed, capital efficiency, risk)
5. **Flag contingencies** (If chosen option fails, what's Plan B?)
6. **Document decision** (Timestamp, rationale, owner, outcome)
